## One place to run the entire company

A real design company operating system is not a static dashboard.

It is a full workflow engine:

**Leads → Clients → Projects → Files → Payments → Performance → Growth**

<Card title="Operating principle" icon="sitemap" horizontal>
Build one connected system where every stage updates the next automatically. No WhatsApp chaos, no disconnected spreadsheets, no blind spots.

## Foundation layer (must build first)

### Roles

- Super Admin
- Admin
- Project Manager
- Designer
- Client
- Finance

### Account status

- Pending
- Active
- Suspended

### Rules

- Every role gets a different dashboard.
- Every role sees different data.
- Finance data is visible only to Finance/Admin.
- Designer accounts cannot access revenue analytics by default.

<Warning>
If role permissions are weak, everything else in the OS is structurally broken.
</Warning>

## MVP implementation path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Define MVP scope">
    Build the minimum end-to-end flow first: **Auth → Leads → Clients → Projects → Invoices → Payments → Basic analytics**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Design database schema">
    Lock core entities and relationships before writing business logic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Implement role-based auth">
    Add JWT, middleware guards, route protection, and per-role dashboard rendering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Build pipeline automation">
    Implement Lead → Client conversion and Project → Invoice → Payment lifecycle.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Add performance + growth analytics">
    Measure designer output, profitability, overdue cash, and client value trends.
  </Step>
</Steps>
